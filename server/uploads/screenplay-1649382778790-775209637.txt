Front-end Functionalities:
a. Ability to add and remove furniture from a specified list of available furniture (i.e., chair,
sofa, table, lamp, tv, fan). Additionally, each of them should have its own properties
like size and states (i.e., lamp on/off, fan on/off, recliner reclined or not, etc.)

2.	Front-end considerations
a.	Feel free to deviate from any of the previous functionality requirements if you feel it is an improvement for the end-user experience.
b.	Feel free to hard-code or use dummy data that you would assume is provided by the back end, since there is no back end. Please indicate in the code.
c.	As this works like a prototype, feel free to use any design assets, coding libraries, or frameworks available to you and scope this assignment up or down where necessary

3. Technological requirements:
a. Front end Using React JS
b. Unit tests coverage
c. ESLINT
d. JSDOC (Documented code)
